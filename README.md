# **My Personal Project**

## *Music Library* 

This application is a music library. The user can create a music library and put
songs into the library along with the name of the artist and information they wish to add,
such as notes like why they love that song so much. The user can later choose to remove songs form the library, as well. 
If the user is not satisfied with the order of the songs, they can choose to shuffle the library. The application will
then shuffle the order of the songs randomly.
The user can also put songs in a favourite list. The application will then make another list just for those songs.

## *Who Will Use It?*

This application is designed for those who loves music. They will be able to keep a collection
of the songs they love and cherish. There often times when people hear a song and immediately fall in love with it.
This application allows those people to write down the songs, artist, and the thoughts and feelings that rushed through
their mind when they heard the song, allowing them to relive the moment.

## *Why This Project Is Of Interest To Me*

I am an avid listener of music. Music is a big part of my life and I listen to music on my phone every single day, when
I walk to school, when I study, sometimes even when I shower.
Every once in a while I hear songs that really catch my attention. For me, every song has their own meaning to my life, 
and I listen to each song depending on my mood. For example, I heard a song when I was in love with someone, and
listening to that specific song brings back precious memories.
Using this application users will be able to remember the songs they hear
and relive the moment later.
This application will not only benefit me but also millions of other music lovers like myself.
